    "text": "The Funding Rate determines which traders pay or receive Funding Fees and what percentage of their positions is involved.\n\nOn Binance Futures, Funding Fees are exchanged regularly to keep the perpetual futures prices aligned with the spot price. Typically, funding occurs every 8 hours, precisely at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC, and 16:00 UTC. However, during periods of significant price divergence between the spot market and the perpetual futures contract, Binance may adjust funding intervals to shorter periods, such as every 4 hours, 2 hours, or even 1 hour, to better manage market stability.\n\nWhen the market is in a state of contango, meaning that the futures prices are higher than the spot price, the Funding Rate will be positive. In this scenario, traders holding long positions in perpetual futures contracts will pay Funding Fees to traders holding short positions.\n\nOn the other hand, when the market is in a state of backwardation, meaning that the futures prices are lower than the spot price, the Funding Rate will be negative. In this scenario, traders holding short positions in perpetual futures contracts will pay Funding Fees to traders holding long positions.\n\nWhat Are Funding Fees in Binance Futures?\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/blog/futures/6595842576313788144\n\nIntroduction to Binance Futures Funding Rates\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360033525031\n\nFor Further details you can refer to above articles as well.",

    "text": "The red/green exclamation(s) you may have seen after the leverage of your position is relevant to the Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) on Binance. Four red exclamations indicate that you are at the top of the queue but even when all are illuminated, ADL happens extremely rarely. As you may know, when the profit-loss difference between long positions and short positions cannot be covered by the Insurance fund, the positions with the highest profit will be closed automatically. This process is called Auto Deleverage or Counterparty Liquidation. ADL is a different transaction from a normal liquidation, in case of ADL you take the current profit on your position and you have the chance to take the position again. You can liken this process to closing your position in profit.\n\nIn the simplified way, you can imagine that there is 1100 USDT to profit but only 1000 USDT in total loss due to the trader’s bankruptcy and of course, normally, Insurance funds will cover this difference. However, when this difference becomes too huge to be handled by Insurance Funds, the users with the most percentage of winnings start to get positions closed by ADL, they of course won’t lose anything and profit completely. The only thing is their positions have to be forcibly closed but they can continuously participate in market anytime after this procedure.\n\nIf possible, please spend a little time to have a closer look at this article:\nhttps://www.binance.com/support/faq/360033525471",

    "text": "The difference between Stop-Market and Stop-Limit orders, based on the pros and cons of market and limit orders:\n\n**Stop-Market Order:**\n\nIt triggers a market order when the stop price is reached.\nYour order will execute immediately at the best available price.\nYou are guaranteed your order will be filled, but the exact price may be different from your stop price, especially in fast-moving markets.\nThis helps protect you from big losses by closing the position quickly but might cause some slippage (difference between expected and actual price).\n\n**Stop-Limit Order:**\n\nIt triggers a limit order when the stop price is reached.\nYour order will only execute at the limit price you set or better, so you control the execution price.\nHowever, your order might not get filled if the market price moves away from your limit price.\nThis gives you price certainty but no guarantee your order will be executed, which can be risky in volatile markets.\n\nIn short:\n\n**Stop-Market =** guaranteed execution, no price guarantee (better for quick exit).\n\n**Stop-Limit =** price guaranteed, no execution guarantee (better when you want to control trade price).\n\nTypes of Order on Binance Futures\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360033779452\n\nChoose the type that matches your trading goal and risk management best!",
